## Welcome to Network AUtomation Repository

 This repository will contain python scripts related to network automation or usefull to network engineers.

  I have written network automation scripts that will help network engineers with legacy devices with basic python skill. these scripts work using telnet and ssh protocols to connect devices and perform GET/POST operations. Repository keeps on updating with new scripts supporting any network device with ssh/telnet and API queries. for details explanation of these scripts please visit firewalllessons.com
